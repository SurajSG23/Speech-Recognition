# Speech Recognition

## Overview

Speech recognition is a field of machine learning that focuses on converting spoken language into text.
It involves analyzing sound waves, extracting useful patterns, and matching them with words or sentences.

## Goals of Speech Recognition

* Turn speech into text
* Understand spoken commands
* Help in voice assistants and transcription
* Make technology accessible for everyone

## Main Steps in Speech Recognition

1. **Signal Recording**

   * Speech is recorded through a microphone and converted into a digital signal.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Removes noise and prepares the sound for analysis by dividing it into small time segments.

3. **Feature Extraction**

   * Converts the sound wave into numbers that describe its main features.
   * Common features:

     * MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
     * Spectrograms
     * Pitch and energy

4. **Acoustic Modeling**

   * Connects sound features to small speech units called phonemes.
   * Uses models such as HMM, GMM, or deep learning networks.

5. **Language Modeling**

   * Helps predict the most likely word order.
   * Example: “I saw a cat” is more likely than “I saw cat a”.

6. **Decoding**

   * Combines both sound and language models to produce the final text.

## How Speech-to-Text Works

```
Speech → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Acoustic Model → Phonemes → Language Model → Words → Text
```

## Applications

* Voice assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
* Automatic transcription (for meetings or videos)
* Voice-controlled systems (smart homes, cars)
* Tools for accessibility (speech-to-text)
